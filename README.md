# To Developers
Hello there, I have recently dicided to make Accentials open source so that developers can make tweaks and see bugs clearly in the code. This is a choice made by myself to allow the community to submit bug fixes for Accentials and submit modified code to me which they feel should be implemented. If I like the idea I will add it and give credit to the developer (Same with bug fixes).

However, I want to keep ownership of Accentials and therefor there are a few things as a developer I request. Copying / Re-Uploading (even if modified) is not allowed. If you wish you can upload source code but certain lines where stated in the code needs to be removed. For example, "This code is the original uploaded by Michelle Winters", needs to be removed. You may put that it is modified by yourself.
We also will not show any respect to people who upload the compiled version to Bukkit or Spigot Resources as this is where the plugin started and we wish to keep this ours. However, if you wish to upload to forums you must provide the github page for your plugin as GNU Liscense states that all source must be visable. You are fully welcome to have a compiled version in your github repository. We also request that you put the link to the original and state the original developer, myself (Michelle Winters / AcePlugins).

# Note
I, Michelle Winters, have it set up to upload the current code to GitHub every time I boot up my local test server. This means the code isn't always working. One way of checking this is by checking the server-log which is uploaded after testing the necessery parts of the plugin allowing you to see what issues there are currently.

# Dependancies
We try and keep dependancies to a minimum but these libraries are required to compile the code:
Spigot / Bukkit:
,,,bash
mkdir spigot
cd spigot
wget https://hub.spigotmc.org/jenkins/job/BuildTools/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/BuildTools.jar
java -jar BuildTools.jar --rev 1.12.1 (version)
,,,
For more info please visit: https://spigotmc.org

# Rules
We want developers to make any preferred modifactions to the project however, Accentials is free and will ALWAYS stay free. If you are caught trying to sell the plugin we will raise it in the chat / forum where you are trying to sell it and report it to admins immediatly that you're trying to sell a FREE product.
We also DO NOT allow force-ops / force-bans or anything which modifies the server / players without the server owners permission. This again also will be raised to the neccesary people.
We also WILL NOT support offine-mode on here unless it is due to bungeecord. This is because Minecraft is a game which you have to pay for and we DO NOT endorse piracy. (Like c'mon man it's cheap enough to buy)
